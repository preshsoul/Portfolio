      <p class="mb-6">Most businesses blame "the algorithm" when their content doesn't perform. But the real problem isn't distribution—it's positioning.</p>
      <p class="mb-6">Here's what I mean: If your content sounds like everyone else in your industry, no amount of posting will differentiate you. You're just adding to the noise.</p>
      <h3 class="text-3xl tanker-font uppercase mt-12 mb-6">The Positioning Problem</h3>
      <p class="mb-6">The brands that win don't have better content calendars. They have clearer positioning. They know:</p>
      <ul class="list-disc pl-6 mb-8 space-y-4">
        <li>What makes them different (not just "better")</li>
        <li>Who they're NOT for (as clearly as who they ARE for)</li>
        <li>What they believe that their competitors don't</li>
      </ul>
      <h3 class="text-3xl tanker-font uppercase mt-12 mb-6">The 3-Step Framework</h3>
      <p class="mb-4"><strong>Step 1: Identify Your Unique Insight</strong></p>
      <p class="mb-6">What do you believe about your industry that most competitors don't? This becomes your content filter.</p>
      <p class="mb-4"><strong>Step 2: Define Your Anti-Positioning</strong></p>
      <p class="mb-6">Be explicit about who you're NOT for. This paradoxically attracts your ideal clients.</p>
      <p class="mb-4"><strong>Step 3: Build Your Content Pillars</strong></p>
      <p class="mb-6">Create 3-5 content themes that reinforce your positioning.</p>
