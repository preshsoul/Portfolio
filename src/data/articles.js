      <p>Most businesses blame "the algorithm" when their content doesn't perform. But the real problem isn't distribution—it's positioning.</p>
      <p>Here's what I mean: If your content sounds like everyone else in your industry, no amount of posting will differentiate you. You're just adding to the noise.</p>
      <h3>The Positioning Problem</h3>
      <p>The brands that win don't have better content calendars. They have clearer positioning. They know what makes them different (not just "better") and who they are NOT for.</p>
      <h3>The 3-Step Framework</h3>
      <p><strong>Step 1: Identify Your Unique Insight.</strong> What do you believe about your industry that most competitors don't? This becomes your content filter.</p>
      <p><strong>Step 2: Define Your Anti-Positioning.</strong> Be explicit about who you're NOT for. This paradoxically attracts your ideal clients.</p>
      <p><strong>Step 3: Build Your Content Pillars.</strong> Create themes that reinforce your unique value proposition.</p>

      <p>When a social enterprise came to me, they had a solid program but kept getting rejected by funders. The problem wasn't their work—it was how they talked about their work.</p>
      <h3>The Challenge</h3>
      <p>Their applications were generic. We reframed their narrative from "we provide training" to "we're closing the agricultural knowledge gap."</p>
      <blockquote>
        "We're closing the agricultural knowledge gap that keeps 60% of Nigerian farmers below the poverty line—one community at a time"
      </blockquote>
      <p>Within three months, they secured $30,000 in grant funding on their first attempt with the new narrative.</p>
