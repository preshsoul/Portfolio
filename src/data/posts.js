      <p class="mb-6">Most businesses blame "the algorithm" when their content doesn't perform. But the real problem isn't distribution—it's positioning.</p>
      
      <p class="mb-6">Here's what I mean: If your content sounds like everyone else in your industry, no amount of posting will differentiate you. You're just adding to the noise.</p>
      
      <h3 class="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-900 mt-8 mb-4">The Positioning Problem</h3>
      
      <p class="mb-6">The brands that win don't have better content calendars. They have clearer positioning. They know:</p>
      
      <ul class="list-disc pl-6 mb-6 space-y-2">
        <li>What makes them different (not just "better")</li>
        <li>Who they're NOT for (as clearly as who they ARE for)</li>
        <li>What they believe that their competitors don't</li>
      </ul>
      
      <h3 class="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-900 mt-8 mb-4">The 3-Step Framework</h3>
      
      <p class="mb-6">Here's the framework I use with clients to move from generic content to strategic positioning:</p>
      
      <p class="mb-4"><strong>Step 1: Identify Your Unique Insight</strong></p>
      <p class="mb-6">What do you believe about your industry that most competitors don't? This becomes your content filter.</p>
      
      <p class="mb-4"><strong>Step 2: Define Your Anti-Positioning</strong></p>
      <p class="mb-6">Be explicit about who you're NOT for. This paradoxically attracts your ideal clients.</p>
      
      <p class="mb-4"><strong>Step 3: Build Your Content Pillars</strong></p>
      <p class="mb-6">Create 3-5 content themes that reinforce your positioning. Every piece of content should ladder up to one of these pillars.</p>
      
      <h3 class="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-900 mt-8 mb-4">Results</h3>
      
      <p class="mb-6">When you get positioning right, your content doesn't need to work harder—it works smarter. You attract the right audience, repel the wrong ones, and stand out in a crowded market.</p>
      
      <p class="mb-6">If your content isn't working, don't blame the algorithm. Fix your positioning first.</p>

    title: "How Strategic Narrative Development Secured $30,000 in Grant Funding",
    date: "January 9, 2025",
    category: "Case Studies",
    excerpt: "When a social enterprise came to me, they had a solid program but kept getting rejected by funders. The problem wasn't their work—it was how they talked about their work. Here's what we changed...",
    content: `
      <p class="mb-6">When a social enterprise came to me, they had a solid program but kept getting rejected by funders. They'd applied to eight grants over six months. Zero success.</p>
      
      <p class="mb-6">The problem wasn't their work—it was how they talked about their work.</p>
      
      <h3 class="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-900 mt-8 mb-4">The Challenge</h3>
      
      <p class="mb-6">This organization provided agricultural training to rural Nigerian communities. Their applications read like this:</p>
      
      <blockquote class="border-l-4 border-emerald-600 pl-6 italic my-6 text-gray-700">
        "We provide agricultural training to rural communities to improve farming outcomes."
      </blockquote>
      
      <p class="mb-6">Generic. Forgettable. Like everyone else.</p>
      
      <h3 class="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-900 mt-8 mb-4">The Strategic Shift</h3>
      
      <p class="mb-6">We didn't change what they did. We changed how they framed it. Here's the process:</p>
      
      <p class="mb-4"><strong>1. Research Phase</strong></p>
      <p class="mb-6">I analyzed successful grant applications in their sector. The pattern was clear: funders care about measurable impact, scalability, and clear theory of change.</p>
      
      <p class="mb-4"><strong>2. Positioning Shift</strong></p>
      <p class="mb-6">We reframed their narrative from "we provide training" to "we're closing the agricultural knowledge gap."</p>
      
      <p class="mb-6"><strong>Before:</strong> "We provide agricultural training to rural communities"</p>
      
      <p class="mb-6"><strong>After:</strong> "We're closing the agricultural knowledge gap that keeps 60% of Nigerian farmers below the poverty line—one community at a time"</p>
      
      <p class="mb-4"><strong>3. Evidence-Based Storytelling</strong></p>
      <p class="mb-6">We backed every claim with data, testimonials, and clear metrics. No fluff, just proof.</p>
      
      <h3 class="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-900 mt-8 mb-4">The Results</h3>
      
      <p class="mb-6">Within three months:</p>
      
      <ul class="list-disc pl-6 mb-6 space-y-2">
        <li>Secured $30,000 in grant funding (first attempt with new narrative)</li>
        <li>Received invitations to two additional funding rounds</li>
        <li>Program expanded to three new communities</li>
      </ul>
      
      <p class="mb-6">Same program. Same team. Different story.</p>
      
      <h3 class="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-900 mt-8 mb-4">Key Takeaway</h3>
      
      <p class="mb-6">Funders don't invest in good programs. They invest in programs that can clearly articulate their impact, theory of change, and scalability.</p>
      
      <p class="mb-6">If you're getting rejected, the problem might not be your work—it might be your narrative.</p>

    title: "Stop Hiring Content Writers. Here's What You Actually Need.",
    date: "January 16, 2025",

    excerpt: "If you're hiring 'content writers,' you're solving the wrong problem. Most businesses don't have a content problem. They have a strategy problem disguised as a content problem.",
    content: `
      <p class="mb-6">If you're hiring "content writers," you're solving the wrong problem.</p>
      
      <p class="mb-6">Most businesses don't have a content problem. They have a strategy problem disguised as a content problem.</p>
      
      <h3 class="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-900 mt-8 mb-4">Here's How I Know</h3>
      
      <p class="mb-6">You're posting 3x per week. Your engagement is decent. But you're not getting clients. Your competitors sound exactly like you. Your team can't articulate what makes you different.</p>
      
      <p class="mb-6">More blog posts won't fix that. Better Instagram captions won't fix that.</p>
      
      <h3 class="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-900 mt-8 mb-4">The Difference</h3>
      
      <p class="mb-6"><strong>Content Writers</strong> execute. They write what you tell them to write. They're tactical.</p>
      
      <p class="mb-6"><strong>Strategic Content Partners</strong> think first, then execute. They ask: "Why are we saying this? Who is this for? What makes this different?"</p>
      
      <p class="mb-6">Most businesses hire executors when they need strategists.</p>
      
      <h3 class="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-900 mt-8 mb-4">When You Need Each</h3>
      
      <p class="mb-6"><strong>Hire a content writer when:</strong></p>
      <ul class="list-disc pl-6 mb-6 space-y-2">
        <li>Your positioning is crystal clear</li>
        <li>Your messaging is tested and proven</li>
        <li>You just need volume and consistency</li>
      </ul>
      
      <p class="mb-6"><strong>Hire a strategic content partner when:</strong></p>
      <ul class="list-disc pl-6 mb-6 space-y-2">
        <li>You sound like your competitors</li>
        <li>Your content gets views but not conversions</li>
        <li>Your team can't explain your differentiation</li>
        <li>You're posting consistently but not seeing results</li>
      </ul>
      
      <h3 class="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-900 mt-8 mb-4">How to Hire for Strategy</h3>
      
      <p class="mb-6">Don't ask: "Can you write blog posts?"</p>
      
      <p class="mb-6">Instead ask:</p>
      <ul class="list-disc pl-6 mb-6 space-y-2">
        <li>"How would you approach understanding our competitive positioning?"</li>
        <li>"What questions would you ask before writing anything?"</li>
        <li>"How do you measure content success beyond vanity metrics?"</li>
      </ul>
      
      <p class="mb-6">If they jump straight to "I'll write 4 blog posts per month," they're an executor, not a strategist.</p>
      
      <h3 class="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-900 mt-8 mb-4">The Bottom Line</h3>
      
      <p class="mb-6">Content without strategy is just noise. Strategy without execution is just theory. You need both—but strategy comes first.</p>
      
      <p class="mb-6">Stop hiring content writers. Start hiring strategic thinkers who can also execute.</p>
