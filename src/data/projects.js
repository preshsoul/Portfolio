    duration: "6 Months",
    challenge: "Despite having a superior product, TechStream was losing market share to competitors with bigger marketing budgets. Their content was technical but lacked a 'hook' that resonated with CEOs.",
    strategy: "We shifted the narrative from 'features' to 'business outcomes.' By developing a proprietary positioning framework, we created 12 high-impact whitepapers that targeted C-suite pain points.",
    results: [
      "200% increase in inbound revenue within two quarters.",
      "45% reduction in Customer Acquisition Cost (CAC).",
      "Featured in three major industry publications."

    challenge: "The NGO had the data, but their grant applications were dry and failed to create an emotional connection with the funder's mission.",
    strategy: "We reframed their impact report into a 'Strategic Narrative.' We shifted the focus from activities (what they do) to systemic change (why it matters).",
    results: [
      "Successfully secured $30,000 in unrestricted funding.",
      "Developed a reusable narrative template for future applications.",
      "100% funder alignment score on first review."
